Uses: pam_sm_authenticate()

Only console/telnet login support with manual BitID login.
- will add other pam users, ssh, ruser, etc.

Fixme:
0. Verify address as valid.
1. Add bitcoin key signing code
2. Read bitcoin.access file
4. Cleanup code and all.
   - pull commit messages into changelog on 'make dist'
   - fixup debian packaging, add make command

5. Announce on bitcointalk bitid thread and pam mailing list

Later:
- Add QR code generation and callback.
- could enable a callback to have live 2fa like the bitID web protocol.

Testing:
- setup login file so it falls back to default login.
(test by having bitcoin.access missing)
